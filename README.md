## BeauCoup: Network Analysis in Resource Constrained Settings 

This repository contains a reimplementation of the BeauCoup network administration system formulated by Chen et al [1]. BeauCoup is comprised of an algorithmic component inspired by the coupon collector's problem in probability theory [2], and a compiler for parameter configuration to optimize system accuracy. 

### Installation
